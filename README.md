# Mech-201-Solidworks-Files

Files from an introductory Solidworks Class I took in Fall 2018. Work starts off very simple in the first couple labs, gets more interesting on the later labs. I learnt how to create complex features and model any physical body in Solidworks, as well as more information on how to create and read Geometric Design and Tolerancing (GD&T) drawings.
